# Project-1-Keiths-Music-Shop

This project was my first for CodeClan and was a great way to reinforce the knowlege I have gained over the first four weeks of the course.

Keiths Music Shop is a web app designed to help a music shop owner to keep track of his stock and additionally as a till.
The music shop owner is able to add and alter artists and albums, and then order stock and sell stock.

I used a ruby gem, rspotify to link the artists and albums to spotify. It pulls down a web player in the album and information about the artist such as popularity and a picture.
