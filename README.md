# Project-1-Keiths-Music-Shop

This project was my first for CodeClan and was a great way to reinforce the knowlege I have gained over the first four weeks of the course.

Keiths Music Shop is a web app for a music shop owner to keep track of his stock.
It links three databases (artists, albums and stock) to a till which allows the user to sell albums. 
The user is also able to alter and add artists, albums and is able to add stock. 

I used a ruby gem, rspotify to link the artists and albums to spotify. It pulls down a web player in the album and information about the artist such as popularity and a picture.
