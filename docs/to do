Q: WHY doesnt :id work in artists?
Went to sinata docs and to access :id I had to go to params['id']


In Album/edit make drop downs select default values

  - Show stock level of all items:
    - High/Medium/Low based on quantity

    Any further analysis would be appreciated but not required, for example:

- Create route that sends down Inventory data as JSON
- Work out the markup for each product ( there could be a buy price and a sell price )
  - Total possible sales & markup on inventory page
- Search functionality on Inventory page
- Associated Genre (Keith associates one Genre to Artists)
