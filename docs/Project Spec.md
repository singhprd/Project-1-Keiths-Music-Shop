## Keith's Music Store

The owner of Keithâ€™s Music Store, Keith, wants an app which will help him keep on top of his store inventory. He does not want an app that customers will see, but he will use to check stock levels, see what he needs to order soon and what is in stock.

You should be able to add to Stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available. He would ideally like to:

- Inventory page
	- Show stock level of all items:
		- High/Medium/Low based on quantity
- Add albums
- Add artists
- Add stock

Any further analysis would be appreciated but not required, for example:

- Create route that sends down Inventory data as JSON
- Work out the markup for each product ( there could be a buy price and a sell price )
	- Total possible sales & markup on inventory page
- Search functionality on Inventory page
- Associated Genre (Keith associates one Genre to Artists)
